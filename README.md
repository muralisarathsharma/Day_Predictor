# Day_Predictor
predicts day of the given date

the following python code uses odd days of month,year and day to get the result
it is divided into different functions so it can be understood easily
you can also run this code in idle or vs code by copying all the functions
its pretty useful while doing the aptitude problems on "dates" since it also uses similar logic to get the result

**note:please provide a valid date it can also give days even though its greater than 31 in date**
thank you :)
